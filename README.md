Lyrics:

Aaarrrggghhhh!!!
I can see the light, I must fight to live another day
I can see the light, hope it's not too late to save my soul
Break this chain, I must break this chain
Break this chain, I must break this chain
'Cause I've had enough of pain and sorrow
I'm not gonna live my life in vain
Break this chain, I must break this chain
Break this chain, I must break this chain
'Cause I've had enough of pain and sorrow...
